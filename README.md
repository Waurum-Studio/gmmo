# Botched RPG
This is a gamemode inspired by MMO/RPG/GACHA games. The main goal is to grind and progress your character like many other RPG games, there isn't really a story as I wanted to focus on the coding and just making it fun to play without a story. The gamemode contains quests, monsters, levelling and crafting.

# Why did I make this gamemode?
I created this as a sort of prototype of what I wanted to make in S&box when that game releases, I used this as a kind of stepping stone for me to make mistakes and know what I actually want to make when that game releases. While I am quite happy with where this gamemode has got to I think I would have prefered if I stepped away from the gacha like equipment/character upgrading system and instead did a more open world, everything is in one inventory and equipment is tradeable etc. I think making it more social by having parties and dungeons also would be a lot better. I also learned that I need to make sure my scope isn't too big and I don't try to do more than I can in a short amount of time.

I also wanted to try making something that could function as a fun gamemode for people to play and didn't include any other addons from other people, I wanted it to be completely coded by me so that I knew what was happening and I could understand all the code, I think I achieved this and it all felt nice and structured.

# Game Style
With this gamemode I wanted to make it feel less like Garry's Mod, to do this I removed the weapon switching system and instead made it so that the main weapon was always out and could be holstered instead, I also made it so that when farming you would go up to the tree/rock and interact with it rather than pulling out a hatchet/pickaxe. Another thing I did was make it 3rd person and use the world models for animation instead of first person, this solved the issue of me not having any skills in animating as I could just attach weapons to the player's hand and run a player animation. Another thing I did was add abilities bound to the number keys which made the game feel more like an MMO/RPG.

# Features
- Crafting - players can collect resources from trees and rocks around the map and craft armour/weapons/equipment
- Quest/mission system - players can start quests where they have to kill monsters in a set amount of time, looking back on this now I would have preffered a more classic accept quests from NPCs with a story etc.
- A bunch of reward systems - this was more of a gacha system that I don't really think I would want if I made this gamemode again.
- Monsters - monsters had spawn points around the map, this used sources Next Bot system, was fun to work with this system as I hadnt at all before, I got it to a fairly good state where the fights were fairly entertaining and active.
- Inventory - fairly basic, items from quests and farming would go in here.
- Characters - never fully finished this, characters were selectable, in the end I would have wanted abilities to be bound to the selected character to therefore make selecting characters not just based on cosmetic but on actual skills etc.
- Map - this was fairly new to me as I wanted to make the map procedurally generated so that I could possibly re use the system in the future, I found a map addon on the workshop (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1124240829) but unfortunately that didnt cover much of the map and didnt have zooming or locations etc, so I made my own using some of the code in the workshop map, although it wasnt perfect I was still fairly happy with it.
- Equipment - I liked this system as players could get equipment and then rankup the equipment and increase the stats of it even if it was some really basic equipment that they started with, however the mechanic that I disliked was the fact that the player could only own one piece of that equipment, this made it feel less like an open world game and more restricted.
